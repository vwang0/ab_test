Breadth First Traversal (BFS) vs Depth First Traversal (DFS) for Binary Tree
What are BFS and DFS for Binary Tree?
A Tree is typically traversed in two ways:

Breadth First Traversal (Or Level Order Traversal)

Depth First Traversals
Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
